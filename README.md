# Welcome!

Hi! My name is Pato, and I'm a front-end web developer. I'm currently learning React Native and studying to develop mobile apps. I love tech because of its ability to improve people's lives, and I'm looking forward to building some great apps.

- 💡 I’m currently learning React Native but flutter and GraphQL have caught my eye.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any fun projects!

- ✉️ You can reach me at my mail: pmontecchiarini.dev@gmail.com or at www.linkedin.com/in/pmontecchiarini

- 📺🎥 Fun fact: I love movies and tv shows. I'm a die-hard X-Phile since my teens.
