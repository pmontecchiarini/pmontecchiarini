# Welcome!

Hi! My name is Pato, and I'm a front-end web developer. I love tech because of it's ability to improve people's lives. I develop with JS, React Js and Wordpress.

- 💡 I’m currently learning React Native and hoping to become a mobile app developer.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any fun projects!

- ✉️ You can reach me at my mail: pmontecchiarini.dev@gmail.com or at www.linkedin.com/in/pmontecchiarini

- 📺🎥 Fun fact: I love movies and tv shows. I'm a die-hard X-Phile since my teens.
